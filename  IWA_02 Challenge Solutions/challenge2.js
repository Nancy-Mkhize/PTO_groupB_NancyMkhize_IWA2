console.log(date); // Outputs the value of date variable to the console

//There is no semicolon (;) at the end of the line that initializes the date variable with a string value. While JavaScript does allow you to omit semicolons in some cases, it's generally considered good practice to include them to avoid potential issues with automatic semicolon insertion.

//The console function is being called without the log method. To output the value of the date variable to the console, you need to call the log method on the console object.
